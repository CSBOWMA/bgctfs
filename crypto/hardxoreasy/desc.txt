A beginner difficulty crypto CTF

The user must guess the encrypted plaintext
that is encrypted using a single pad xor cypher.
They are able to test up to two strings against the key 
to guess the plaintext. 

Designed to show that even with a single pad and random text,
encryption can still be weak if the user can test on it and
the encryption algorithm is insecure.
